this is just a quite jot to explain the project. the md will be complete with a website too later on.

Waves (Web Application Vulnerability Assessment Suite) is a successor of Wabbit, a cli website application pentesting tool. unlike wabbit, its built ontop of Wet, a cli like app in python. it works like a normal command line but has its own set of commands, tools, and extensibility with plugins.

Waves is made up of
  Wet, the cli base
    Tide, its package manager
      Droplets, packages in Tide
      Lakes, groups of Packages in Tide
      (tbd), settings and themes
    (tbd), plugin manager
      (tbd), plugins that change how Water acts

and other things ill add later.
I also will make a repository of the plugins and Tide stuff called Sea, and a website for it, and possibly other things related to wet, called Ocean

names i may use in the future:
  water
  tide
  drops
  rivers
  rain
  H2O

is this a big project, yes. am i likely to actually get a full release, no. will i work on this tho, yes.
